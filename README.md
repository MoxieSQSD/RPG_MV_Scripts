This is an online repository for the Game Design class. The purpose is to store javascript files for RPG Maker MV. 
Each script is broken down into folders with the main .js file and any required files included.
Lastly, any help files, tutorials or links to the original scripts (on Github or elsewhere) are included.
All of these scripts are created by others and credit goes to them. This site is for educational purposes only.
